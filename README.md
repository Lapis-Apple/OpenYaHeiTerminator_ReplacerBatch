## Open YaHei Terminator Project - Batch replacer

This is the replacer for Microsoft YaHei, if you already had a patched font that ready to replace.

The Administrator permission is required to replace. 

You don't need a Windows PE or something to use this script, but you may have to log out for 2 times.

Still in development, may containing unknown bugs. use it as your own risk!
