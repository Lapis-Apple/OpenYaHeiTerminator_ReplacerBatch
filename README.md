## Open YaHei Terminator Project - Batch replacer

This is a replace tool for Microsoft YaHei if you already have a patched font ready to be replaced into your system.

The replacement process requires administrator privileges.

You don't need Windows PE or other tools to use this script, but you may need to log out 2 times.

Still in development and may contain unknown bugs. Use it at your own risk!

## Thanks
This project is based on https://github.com/Moeologist/font-hack.
